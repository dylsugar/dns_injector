This homework took me a while :). So my first step was figuring out how to even sense when a query to a host that was in hostnames was going to take place. But first, I had to parse out the hostnames file into a key-pair dictionary, so I can immediately lookup when a query to a certain ip address was initiated. Once my program started sniffing the local network, when a packet is sent over dig or nslookup, sniff picks it up and is sent through the inject_packet method. My inject_packet method first checks the question section of the packet if the packet is a an actual DNS packet based on its header values. If it is and we have the hostnames, then we can make our spoofed packet. Our spoof packet has to flip the src and dst ports of IP and UDP because we are using a spoofed ip for the host instead of the one sent by the DNS resolver. In order to carry on seemlessley however, we have to store none of the packets which is why store is set to 0, then we can use dig/nslookup as many types as we want.
